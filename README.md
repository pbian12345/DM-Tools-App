# DM-Tools-App
Just a little in-browser tool set to make managing a session as a DM a little easier.

The app is a central hub for various user-managed cards that can be minimized and moved around in whatever method the user prefers.
Card types:
- Initiative Tracker
- Searchable Spell List
- Searchable Monster list
- Encounter Tracker
- External embedded site (stretch goal)

INSTALLATION:
Super simple, just get a local copy and drag the html into your browser.
